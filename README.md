## Overview

**Emotion Sense** is a multilingual web application designed to detect emotions in tweets in real time. Built with Streamlit, the app allows users to input a tweet URL or plain text and receive predictions of emotional labels using models trained on the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets dataset.

Our system supports both **English** and **Spanish** tweets and includes the following models:
- Naive Bayes (English)
- Logistic Regression (English)
- CNN (English)
- CNN (Spanish)

We experimented with all three approaches‚ÄîNaive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and CNN‚Äîbut found that the **CNN significantly outperformed the others**, especially in detecting nuanced and rare emotions. As a result, **we selected the CNN as the final deployed model** in the application.
